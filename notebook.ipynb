{"cells":[{"source":"The Nobel Prize has been among the most prestigious international awards since 1901. Each year, awards are bestowed in chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. In addition to the honor, prestige, and substantial prize money, the recipient also gets a gold medal with an image of Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896), who established the prize.\n\n![](Nobel_Prize.png)\n\nThe Nobel Foundation has made a dataset available of all prize winners from the outset of the awards from 1901 to 2023. The dataset used in this project is from the Nobel Prize API and is available in the `nobel.csv` file in the `data` folder.\n\nIn this project, you'll get a chance to explore and answer several questions related to this prizewinning data. And we encourage you then to explore further questions that you're interested in!","metadata":{},"id":"db5bd2ce-918a-4f7d-a927-a3ea74c4b456","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Loading in required libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\n","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":9,"lastExecutedAt":1719180062959,"lastExecutedByKernel":"12430fb6-d86f-4625-9ec2-fca99d726e33","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Loading in required libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\n"},"id":"11fd5946-7bd1-495c-aa7f-ff6e7e4a350b","cell_type":"code","execution_count":84,"outputs":[]},{"source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"data/nobel.csv\")\ndf.head()","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":53,"lastExecutedAt":1719180063012,"lastExecutedByKernel":"12430fb6-d86f-4625-9ec2-fca99d726e33","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"df = pd.read_csv(\"data/nobel.csv\")\ndf.head()","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":213,"type":"dataFrame"}}},"cell_type":"code","id":"24dc9e4d-d879-4aab-85fc-d3be595a180c","outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"year","type":"integer"},{"name":"category","type":"string"},{"name":"prize","type":"string"},{"name":"motivation","type":"string"},{"name":"prize_share","type":"string"},{"name":"laureate_id","type":"integer"},{"name":"laureate_type","type":"string"},{"name":"full_name","type":"string"},{"name":"birth_date","type":"string"},{"name":"birth_city","type":"string"},{"name":"birth_country","type":"string"},{"name":"sex","type":"string"},{"name":"organization_name","type":"string"},{"name":"organization_city","type":"string"},{"name":"organization_country","type":"string"},{"name":"death_date","type":"string"},{"name":"death_city","type":"string"},{"name":"death_country","type":"string"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":{"index":[0,1,2,3,4],"year":[1901,1901,1901,1901,1901],"category":["Chemistry","Literature","Medicine","Peace","Peace"],"prize":["The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1901","The Nobel Prize in Literature 1901","The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1901","The Nobel Peace Prize 1901","The Nobel Peace Prize 1901"],"motivation":["\"in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by the discovery of the laws of chemical dynamics and osmotic pressure in solutions\"","\"in special recognition of his poetic composition, which gives evidence of lofty idealism, artistic perfection and a rare combination of the qualities of both heart and intellect\"","\"for his work on serum therapy, especially its application against diphtheria, by which he has opened a new road in the domain of medical science and thereby placed in the hands of the physician a victorious weapon against illness and deaths\"",null,null],"prize_share":["1/1","1/1","1/1","1/2","1/2"],"laureate_id":[160,569,293,462,463],"laureate_type":["Individual","Individual","Individual","Individual","Individual"],"full_name":["Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff","Sully Prudhomme","Emil Adolf von Behring","Jean Henry Dunant","Frédéric Passy"],"birth_date":["1852-08-30","1839-03-16","1854-03-15","1828-05-08","1822-05-20"],"birth_city":["Rotterdam","Paris","Hansdorf (Lawice)","Geneva","Paris"],"birth_country":["Netherlands","France","Prussia (Poland)","Switzerland","France"],"sex":["Male","Male","Male","Male","Male"],"organization_name":["Berlin University",null,"Marburg University",null,null],"organization_city":["Berlin",null,"Marburg",null,null],"organization_country":["Germany",null,"Germany",null,null],"death_date":["1911-03-01","1907-09-07","1917-03-31","1910-10-30","1912-06-12"],"death_city":["Berlin","Châtenay","Marburg","Heiden","Paris"],"death_country":["Germany","France","Germany","Switzerland","France"]}},"total_rows":5,"truncation_type":null},"text/plain":"   year    category  ... death_city death_country\n0  1901   Chemistry  ...
